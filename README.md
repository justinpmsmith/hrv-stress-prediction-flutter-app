This repository holds the front end of the the stress prediction from heart rate variation project. 
the mobile application connects to an ECG chest strap from where it recieves raw heart rate variation data.

The predictions get stored in a database where they can be fetched from by the frontend and displayed in a graph. 
The backend for this project is stored in the hrv-stress-prediction-backend repository.
